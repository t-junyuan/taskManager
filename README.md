### 15 January 2025
I have decided to try and plan through the entire development of the project, trying to do every single step of a software development process
- Project scoping
- Brainstorming
- Running a somewhat agile process

### 16 January 2025
After having come up with a rough design of what the system will look like, I wanted to create a fully functional pipeline that would trigger the build verification tests.

However after trying it out, there may be issues with hosting Jenkins (I may need to pay lmao). My previous project on learning how to use jenkins used a Docker to run a jenkins image on local host, which can't be connected without workarounds to git.
